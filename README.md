## Task
To build a tic-tac-toe web application, you can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By implementing fuctions to handle user clicks, track game state, and check for winning conditions, you can create an interactive and
engaging tic-tac-toe game. With these technologies and functionalities, userss can play against each other or against each otheror against an AI opponent, aiming to get three markers in a row to win the game.

**Overview:**
The Tic-Tac-Toe Game project is a classic implementation of the popular two-player board game. It provides a simple yet engaging platform for users to play the game against each other.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Programming Language:** Javascript
- **User Interface:**  HTML/CSS for a web-based game.

**Closing:**
The Tic-Tac-Toe Game project provides a practical introduction to programming logic, user interface development, and the fundamentals of game design. It's a great starting point for expanding into more complex game development projects.
